      <h2>Intro</h2>
      <p>Hi, I'm Kelly Interiano, a passionate Computer Engineering student at Bucknell University, with a minor in Physics. I'm always excited about technology and how it shapes our future, especially in the fields of embedded systems and AI/machine learning. Currently, I'm a rising junior and actively seeking internship opportunities to grow my skills further.</p>
      <h2>Hobbies</h2>
      <p>When I'm not deep into code, you can find me playing soccer, exploring the outdoors, or spending quality time with friends and family. I'm also committed to creating themed STEM activities for young kids, hoping to inspire the next generation of engineers and problem solvers.</p>
      
      <h2>Currently</h2>
      <p>On my engineering journey, I've worked on projects like building a Python-based game called 'Lost Rovers,' where a rover navigates planets to fix a spaceship. Additionally, I'm involved in a design team addressing food insecurity caused by climate change through innovative engineering solutions.</p>

      <h2>Future Plans</h2>
      <p>After graduating, I plan to continue my studies in AI and make meaningful contributions to the tech world. Feel free to connect if you're interested in collaboration or just want to chat about tech, nature, or soccer!</p>
